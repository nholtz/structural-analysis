    "## About Frame2D\n",
    "Frame2D performs the analysis of 2-D structural frames using the matrix-stiffness methods.  It can perform either\n",
    "a normal first order analysis, or a $2^{nd}$-order analysis using the $P-\\Delta$ (or fictitous force) method.  Given inputs of node and member loads, and support displacements, it computes free node displacements and member\n",
    "end forces (shear, axial and moment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Input consists of tables describing:\n",
    " - node coordinates\n",
    " - node fixity (support constraints)\n",
    " - member incidence (connectivity to nodes)\n",
    " - force releases in members (hinges only, at this time)\n",
    " - member properties (moment of inertia and area)\n",
    " - node loads\n",
    " - transverse member loads\n",
    " - support displacements\n",
    " - load combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Output consists of:\n",
    " - node displacements\n",
    " - reaction forces\n",
    " - member end forces (shear axial and moment at each end)\n",
    " - optionally, a simple line drawing of the frame\n",
    " \n",
    "Data input can be provided by any combination of the following:\n",
    " - CSV data directly in notebook cells using the `%%Table` cell magic, or\n",
    " - CSV files in a particular directory, or\n",
    " - tables computed by another program\n",
    " \n",
    "A 'proper' geometric $2^{nd}$-order capability is planned for the not too distant future."
