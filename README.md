# Structural Analysis using Jupyter/Python notebooks

Example notebooks dealing with the analysis of structures. 
These are mostly university third and fourth year level (i.e., fairly introductory)
and use stiffness methods (slope-deflection for the introductory
examples and matrix methods for the more advanced).

That is, they will; currently only a few slope-deflection examples are shown
(under [slope-deflection/](slope-deflection)) and there is the barest
start of a 2d frame program (under [matrix-methods/frame2d](matrix-methods/frame2d).

They all using a Jupyter notebook interface and and programmed in Python (2.7)  using modules numpy,
sympy, matplotlib and a lot of home-built stuff.
